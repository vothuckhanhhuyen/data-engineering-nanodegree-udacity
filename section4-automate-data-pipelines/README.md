## Automate Data Pipelines

In this course, you'll learn about the concept of data pipelines, and how you can use them to accelerate your career as a data engineer.

This course will focus on applying the data pipeline concepts you'll learn through an open-source tool from Airbnb called Apache Airflow.

In the first lesson, you'll learn about data pipeline concepts including:
- Data Validation
- Direct Acyclic Graphs (DAG)
- DAGs in Apache Airflow
- Building DAGs and running them in Airflow

In the second lesson, we'll cover data quality concepts including
- Data lineage in Airflow
- Data pipeline schedules
- Data partitioning

The third lesson is about using data pipelines in production. You'll learn about:
- Extending Airflow with Plugins
- Task boundaries and when to refactor a DAG
